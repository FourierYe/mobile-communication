As we can see from diagram, the carrier component would reduce with the increasing of m, from 0.75, 1 to 1.5. In addition the signal of $cos(w-u)$ and $cos(w+u)$ would increase with the increasing of m.

The reason is shown below.

$AM = E(1+mcosut)coswt$

​         $= A*(1+m*cosut)B*coswt$ 

​         $=E[coswt+m*cosut*coswt]$

​         $=E\{coswt+\frac{m}{2}[cos(w-u)t+cos(w+u)t]\}$     



As we can see from diagram, the demodulated messages are recovered successfully deponding on the m. When $m \leq 1$ (0.75 || 1.0), the demodulated messages can be recovered successfully, however when $m>1$, the demodulated messages can't be recovered successfully.
